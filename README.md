# vue-pomodoro

🍅 Pomodoro Timer built using Vue 2. ✌️

## Project setup 🏗️

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development 🚧

```
yarn serve
```

## Part 1 ⏰

In Part 1, we will go through the initial setup & get the timer & animation working for our Pomodoro app.

This Vue project will be a single page app, therefore we do not need to use [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/).

We will be using [progressbar.js](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/progressbar.js) for the animation of the Pomodoro timer progress bar. However, there are a few issues we might encounter when using this to build our animation. Don't worry, we will fix it in Part 2. 😉
