# vue-pomodoro

🍅 Pomodoro Timer built using Vue 2. ✌️

## Project setup 🏗️

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development 🚧

```
yarn serve
```

## Part 3 🎉

In Part 3, we will develop the 'rest countdown' feature with additional styling improvements.

We will also add a confetti effect when all Pomodoros are complete, signaling an achievement! For this, we will use [canvas-confetti](https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti) to help us with the effect.
