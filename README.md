# vue-pomodoro

Pomodoro Timer built using Vue 2.

## Project setup

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
yarn serve
```

#### Part 1

In Part 1, we will go through the initial setup & get the timer & animation working for our Pomodoro app.

#### Part 2

For Part 2, we will implement functions that will run when the timer hits zero. We will also add sound effects & improvements to help with the user experience.

#### Part 3

During Part 3, we will develop the rest countdown feature with additional styling improvements.
We will also add additional flair when all Pomodoros are completed and restart fresh for a new session.

#### Future Improvements

[] Settings to allow users to customize Pomodoro sessions
[] Task lists & UX improvements to create a more 'motivational feel'
