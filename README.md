🍅 Pomodoro Timer built using Vue 2. ✌️

## Project setup 🏗️

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development 🚧

```
yarn serve
```

## Part 2 ⏰

In Part 2, we will add our sound effects, implement part of the rest feature timer, and start working on the pause & resume function!

We will start by fixing the issues from Part 1, namely the incorrect animation timing when the timer is paused. We will also add some improvements to help with the user experience. We are going to complete everything and work on some finishing touches in Part 3!
