## Project Flow

### Part 1 ⏰

In Part 1, we will go through the initial setup & get the timer & animation working for our Pomodoro app.

### Part 2 🔔

For Part 2, we will implement functions that will run when the timer hits zero. We will also add sound effects & improvements to help with the user experience.

### Part 3 🎉

During Part 3, we will develop the rest countdown feature with additional styling improvements.
We will also add additional flair when all Pomodoros are completed and restart fresh for a new session.

### Future Improvements 💡

- [ ] Settings to allow users to customize Pomodoro sessions
- [ ] Task lists & UX improvements to create a more 'motivational feel'
